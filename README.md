# Scythe Viewer

A companion tool of [scythe](https://github.com/mapio/scythe).

## Details

The viewer is a local web application based on the following awesome projects:

* (Jasny fork of) [Bootstrap](https://github.com/jasny/bootstrap),
* [jQuery](http://jquery.com/),
* (Mottie fork of) [tablesorter](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter),
* [FileSaver.js](https://github.com/eligrey/FileSaver.js),
* [Mousetrap](http://craig.is/killing/mice), and
* [highlight.js](http://softwaremaniacs.org/soft/highlight/en/).

to make deployment simpler, the code from these projects is included in the app
and is part of this repo. Original software (and copywright notes) can be found
at the above sites.

The previous incarnation of this application was [see-you-viewer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mapio/see-you-viewer).
